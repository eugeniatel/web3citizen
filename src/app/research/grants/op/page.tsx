        <h2>Foundation Missions (RFPs)</h2>
       
        <p>Foundation Missions are proposals for specific initiatives that achieve a Collective Intent.</p>
        <p>Foundation Missions act as requests for proposals (RFPs) that teams can apply for. Missions also typically come with specified grant amounts for their completion.</p>
    <p>The idea is simple: you craft what the Foundation has outlined and, in return, you are compensated based on the perceived effort it entails. It's an excellent opportunity, especially if you're keen to contribute but don't have a personal project in the pipeline.</p>
   <p>Grant scope varies! You can view the full list of Foundation Missions (RFPs) <a className={styles.a}> here.</a></p>
