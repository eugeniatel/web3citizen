     <h1>What is the Ethereum Support Program</h1>
     <p>The Ethereum Foundation has launched the Ecosystem Support Program (ESP) to encourage and facilitate the development of the Ethereum ecosystem. The ESP consists of two grants, one dedicated to smaller projects and another for larger projects, both aimed at promoting growth and innovation within the Ethereum community.</p>
   
   <br></br>
   <h1>How to know which grant to apply for?</h1>
   
   <p>Project Grants can have a longer execution timeline, or will require you to make new long-term hires. They also undergo an intensive process of review and often evolve significantly from the initial application in collaboration with the ESP team.</p>
   <p>You can get in contact with the ESP for further guidance on your application.</p>

     <h1>Scope</h1>
     <p>The ESP focuses on work that â€œstrengthens Ethereum's foundations and enables future builders, such as open source tooling, building blocks and libraries, research, community building, educational resources, open standards, infrastructure and protocol improvements.</p>


     <p>The Ecosystem Support Program seek to support the development of initiatives of:</p>

   <li>Infrastructure
   </li>
   <li>Other grant programs and public goods funding platforms</li>
