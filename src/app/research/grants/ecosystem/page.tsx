    <p> The Ethereum Foundation has launched the Ecosystem Support Program (ESP) to encourage and facilitate the development of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
    <p>The ESP consists of two grants, one dedicated to smaller projects and another for larger projects, both aimed at promoting growth and innovation within the Ethereum community.</p>

    <section className={styles.section}>
     <p className={styles.black}>Grant Scope</p>
     <p>The ESP focuses on work that â€œstrengthens Ethereum's foundations and enables future builders, such as open source tooling, building blocks and libraries, research, community building, educational resources, open standards, infrastructure and protocol improvements.</p>


     <p>The Ecosystem Support Program seek to support the development of initiatives of:</p>

   <ul className={styles.list}>
     <li>Software and protocol developers</li>
     <li>Research</li>
     <li>Community initiatives, education and event sponsorship</li>
   <li>Builder Tools</li>
   <li>Infrastructure
   </li>
   <li>Other grant programs and public goods funding platforms</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Funding is generally directed to supporting builders rather than end users.</p>

        <p>Project Grants can have a longer execution timeline, or will require you to make new long-term hires. They also undergo an intensive process of review and often evolve significantly from the initial application in collaboration with the ESP team.</p>
        <p>You can get in contact with the ESP for further guidance on your application.</p>

      <p className={styles.black}>Funding Specifics</p>
      <p>The Ecosystem Support Program can provide payment in ETH, DAI, or fiat currency.</p>
